pretty easy.

??, looks for the first defined value, for example

```js
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";

// shows the first defined value:
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
```

it basically just looks for the first defined value, so if nickName was something like boss it'd be boss or if firstName was like x it'd return x before supercoder


```js

let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";

// shows the first truthy value:
alert(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // Supercoder

```

thats for ors
