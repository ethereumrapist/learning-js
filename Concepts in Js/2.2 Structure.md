STATEMENTS

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that do something / perform actions, an example would be alert('Hello world')

'Hello world' could be split into 2 alerts by doing:

alert('hello'); alert('world')

OR

alert('hello');
alert('world');

OR

alert('hello')
alert('world') -- a line break will omit the use of a semi colon

ALTHOUGH
it is safer to use them even though they arent completely needed, javascript sometimes doesnt realise that one isnt needed and will see code different from the way you do.


-------------------------------------
COMMENTS

// - is used to comment

EXAMPLE:

// Hi g. I am ethrapist future P1 coinbase shinycorp caller dev.

You can also do

alert('Hi g.'); // Hi g.

The difference is that the top one is its own line, and the bottom follows a line.

It is also possible to do multiline comments using /* and */

EXAMPLE:

/* Hi bro.
I am ethrapist g.
*/

You can also put parts of your code into this to edit and debug.

COMMENT SHORTCUTS:

<!-- To comment a line out you do ctrl + /  -->

<!-- To comment out multiple lines
Of code
You highlight what you want to comment out, And
CTRL + / -->

Nested comments are not supported

EXAMPLE

/* Hi 
g */ Yo g.
/*
