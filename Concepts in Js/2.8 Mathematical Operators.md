MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS

+ addition
* multiplication
/ division
- subtraction


operand = what the operator is applied to

5 + 2

left operand = 5 
right operand = 2

------------------------

```js

let a = 5

a = -a
alert(a) // result -5

```

an operator is unary if it has 1 operand, binary is 2 operands.

------------------------

% - remainder

7 % 3 = 1

** = exponentation, basically adding a power

2 ** 4 = 2 small 4

for square roots you'd do:

2 ** (1/3) - cubic root of 2

-----------------------

-----------------------

increment / decrement:

++/-- after a variable, only works on variables

prefix = just adds 1
postfix = returns the current value, then adds one

let x = 1;
console.log(x++ + x++);  // 3

++x: increment first, then use.

x++: use first, then increment. 

x++ + ++x = 1 + 2 = 3
++x + x++ = 2 + 2 = 4

say if you now repeat that after the first one it'd be

x++ + ++x = 2 + 3 = 5


-----------------------

assignments = basically like equations

```js

let a = 2
let b = 6

let c = a - b * a 


// can also be chained like this.

a = b = c = 2 + 2;

// this is too possible 

let n = 5
n += 500
n *= 2

alert(n)
```

tasks = 

```js

let a = 1, b = 1;

let c = ++a; // ?
let d = b++; // ?

// answers
// a = 2
// b = 2
// c = 2
// d = 1 - because b is postfix, itll only show after.


let a = 2;

let x = 1 + (a *= 2);

// answers
// a = 4 - it is being multiplied by 2
// x = 5, a + 1

"" + 1 + 0
"" - 1 + 0
true + false
6 / "3"
"2" * "3"
4 + 5 + "px"
"$" + 4 + 5
"4" - 2
"4px" - 2
"  -9  " + 5
"  -9  " - 5
null + 1
undefined + 1
" \t \n" - 2

answers
"" + 1 + 0 = "10" // (1)
"" - 1 + 0 = -1 // (2)
true + false = 1
6 / "3" = 2
"2" * "3" = 6
4 + 5 + "px" = "9px"
"$" + 4 + 5 = "$45"
"4" - 2 = 2
"4px" - 2 = NaN
"  -9  " + 5 = "  -9  5" // (3)
"  -9  " - 5 = -14 // (4)
null + 1 = 1 // (5)
undefined + 1 = NaN // (6)
" \t \n" - 2 = -2 // (7)

// rules i need to remember

The addition with a string "" + 1 converts 1 to a string: "" + 1 = "1", and then we have "1" + 0, the same rule is applied.

The subtraction - (like most math operations) only works with numbers, it converts an empty string "" to 0.

The addition with a string appends the number 5 to the string.

The subtraction always converts to numbers, so it makes " -9 " a number -9 (ignoring spaces around it).

null becomes 0 after the numeric conversion.

undefined becomes NaN after the numeric conversion.

Space characters are trimmed off string start and end when a string is converted to a number. Here the whole string consists of space characters, such as \t, \n and a “regular” space between them. So, similarly to an empty string, it becomes 0.
