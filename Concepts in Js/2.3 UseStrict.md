The modern mode, Use strict.

For a while, Java evolved without any compatibility issues. New features were added but compatibility never changed. That had the benefit of never breaking code.

In 2009, Javascript reworked some old features, breaking old code, but this feature to automatically update them was usually off automatically, This is where ' USE STRICT ' comes in.

"USE SCRIPT"; ensures that your code is used the modern way, it sits at the top of your code.

If not at the very top, It may not be enabled.

Once strict mode is activated, Theres no going back

For now it must be used, but when moving onto modules it may be automatically on so it can be omitted.
