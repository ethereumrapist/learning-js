VARIABLES G.


---------------------
Variable Concepts:

A variable is a named storage for data, can be used to store numbers, strings, data literally anything

Variables are made using `let`, `var` and `const`
These all make a different type of variable, We will run through them.

--------------------

LET VARIABLES:

Let variables are made by doing

```js

let message; // semi colon used as a good practice
message = 'Yo g.' // 'Yo g.' Being the value of message.

// Variables can also be declared in one message:

let message = 'Yo g.'

// Then it can be put into an alert, or things like that

let message = 'Yo g.'
alert(message)

// Result = Yo g.
// Multiple variables can also be declared in one line by doing this:

let message = 'Yo g.', age = 900, boss = 'Maneki.';

alert(message, age, boss)

// can also be done in these ways

let message = 'Yo g.',
age = 900,
boss = 'Maneki.';

OR

let message = ...
let age = ...
let boss = ...

// Result = Yo g. 900 Maneki.

// Value can also be changed by simply doing this

let message = 'Axxxx';

message = 'Boss.'

// Declaring a variable twice will result in a syntax error, Example:

let message = 'boss g.'
let message = 'Xd.'

// Statements cannot be used as variable names.

```

--------------------

CONSTANT / CONST VARIABLES

A constant is a variable that is unchangeable, Hence constant
An attempt to change will result in an error.

Constants with hard to remember values are named in Uppercase and With underscores an example would be const `COLOR_ORANGE ="#FF7F00"`

Some constants may be calculated in the runtime, instead of predetermined, like the loading time of a page.

```js

const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00"
const PageLoadTime = // time taken for the page to load.

```

--------------------

VARIABLE NAMING.

some good rules to follow are:

/Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.

/Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, and c, unless you know what you’re doing.

/Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value. Such names say nothing. It’s only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.

/Agree on terms within your team and in your mind. If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.
