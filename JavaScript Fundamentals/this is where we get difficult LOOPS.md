ok loops g finally im back. we must lock in.

while loops are pretty self explanatory

while (condition) {
    // blah blah blah
    // basically what you want ot loop
}

example:

```js

let g = 100

while (g < 100){
    alert('g.')
    ++g
}

```

do while loop syntax or whatever, basically same

```js

let i = 0

do{
  alert(i--)
}while (i < 3);


```


for loops. this is where it gets difficult g.

```js 
for (begin; condition; step) {
  // ... loop body ...
}
```
